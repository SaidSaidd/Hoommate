					<h2>Our Story</h2>
				    <p> 
                        Once upon a time, in a quaint college town, there was a group of friends, who had just completed their first year at university. The friends - Said, Nuriddin, Justin and Noor - had all experienced the challenges of finding a compatible roommate firsthand. Finding suitable roommates was a struggle that many students had to endure. As they sat together in a cozy cafe discussing their experiences, an idea began to take form. The friends decided to build a website to help students find their perfect roommate match.
                         </p>
					<p>As the friends started brainstorming, they realized that each of them brought a unique skill to the table. Justin and Noor, the coding wizards, would be in charge of building the website from scratch. Said, the talented designer and up and coming front-end expert, would work on creating an engaging and user-friendly interface. Nurik, the talented data science major, would help develop the algorithm that matched students based on personality traits and preferences.</p>
                    <p> After a full day's work, countless cups of coffee and a sleepless night later, the friends had created "Hoommate," a user-friendly and intuitive website that aimed to revolutionize the way students found roommates.
                    </p>
                    <p>With the algorithm in place, Hoommate would provide a list of potential matches, ranked by compatibility. Students could then browse their matches, and eventually decide.</p>
